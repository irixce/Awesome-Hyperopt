# TEAM 2 - Auto Hopts

* #### Thrasyvoulos Karydis
    Hi everyone, I am the co-founder and CTO of DeepCure. I'm from Greece (if not obvious by the name)!
    My undergrad degree was in EECS with a major in Quantum Information Theory. The past 5 years I was working on applications of Machine Learning/AI in 
    protein engineering at the MIT Media Lab. Really excited to be hosted at the VDC and to have the opportunity to work with you during the semester!

    Hi team! We mostly know each other but it's always good to have more background! I'm graduating this year with a B.S. in C.S. As part of the school's
    high performance computing team, James and I worked on the AI application. I was also in the AI class with a couple of you, worked on a basic
    HoloLens app that integrated vision and translation services, worked in healthcare for about 4 years, did a small research projects on bioinformatics and
    topological data analysis before coming to UMass Boston, did 3 program manager internships at Microsoft, am joining the Microsoft AI Development Acceleration
    Program after graduation, and am really passionate about team organization, collaboration, and agile development practices.

    Hello everyone! I'm not sure how much you know about me. To be honest I don't have many interesting things in my life. I am a Senior now and will be finishing
    with a B.S in CS. I've only been going to school here for two years and I am finishing early. I started playing with computers because of video games and it has
    just stemmed as a love of mine. I have been coding and doing design work since I was thirteen. My skills are definitely not where close to where I want them to be. 
    School has been fun, but I find it hard to ever do a project for my portfolio. So I am really excited to be a part of this team and get something up on my resume. 
    I'm excited to work with everyone and practice professional level development with all of you. Finally, I am from California and came here because I like the cold 
    and wanted to be far from my family to experience new things.

    Hi everyone!! I'm CS major and Math minor. I'm from India. I will be graduating in Fall 2019 (So two more semester). I am also in school's high performance 
    computing team. I am really enthusiastic to work on this project as I have never expeience working in group with more than 2 members. I have only worked on 
    projects assigned from classes and so this will be very good learning experince and also will able to work on a huge project. I really look forward to work with 
    deepcare.

   Hello team! Very excited to be working on DeepCure's project with all of you this semester! I am a senior pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science. 
   I graduated high school in Massachusetts in 2015. Most of my experience in the field has been research-oriented. My first research experience was in a systems 
   neuroscience lab, where I worked with Julia, Python, and OpenCV to apply feature-matching algorithms to neuron-level brain images of larval zebra fish. Since then, 
   I became involved in projects applying neural nets using Tensorflow (started on a project for crime hotspot prediction and one for predicting human fixation maps). 
   More recently, I had my first research experience in industry. The work there was more client-facing and encompassed natural language processing and artificial 
   intelligence for text classification. Towards the end of this experience, I got the chance to engineer a production-ready, large-scale system for 
   integrating the pipeline for prediction. I worked with one other person on this project, and I took the semester off in Fall 2018 to develop it. 
   It was the best experience I've ever had, and through it, I realized my passion for software engineering and the significance of working in a team. 
   It makes me all the more excited to get involved this semester, and I look forward to experiencing the development of our product.

   Hello everybody! I’m also graduating this year with a B.S. in C.S. This is my
   4th semester at UMass Boston after having received my associates degree at
   Cape Cod Community College. I moved back to Massachusetts to begin my college
   education after working at a logistics company in New York City for 11 years,
   before that was high school in western MA. Prior to this the largest
   project I’ve worked on was the development of a neural network to identify
   and mark craters on NASA satellite images of the Martian surface. As a team
   of 5 we studied an MNIST classification network written in Python using
   Theano before starting from scratch using Keras with a Tensorflow backend.
   Additional features were added to handle image processing (OpenCV, Numpy,
   PIL). I’ve worked with Kristen and Rudresh for the Student Cluster
   Competition (the HPC team Kristen mentioned), and very much look forward to
   working with this team and DeepCure.
